      <p>Over the course of 8 weeks, students will first examine core facets where AI is poised to transform learning (e.g., ideation, research, synthesis, composition, simulation). Building on this foundation, students will work both individually and in interdisciplinary teams to prototype learning tools, starting with their own personal learning goals and broadening the scope to consider how these solutions might scale to serve the needs of learners beyond themselves.</p>
      <p>In parallel, this workshop will cultivate the essential skills required to live and lead in an AI-driven world. Students will move beyond being passive users and become critical, discerning architects of their interactions with AI. This includes developing proficiency in prompt engineering, learning to rigorously test and validate AI outputs, critically examining AI-generated information for potential biases and inaccuracies, and thinking about the broader implications of AI technology and its adoption.</p>

          <h3 class="blue">Weeks 1 - 4</h3>
          <p>Students will work in small teams, using <a href="https://gemini.google/overview/canvas/?hl=en">Gemini Canvas</a> to build multiple bespoke solutions for a learning problem that they have identified and take note of what works and what doesn't.  As an example, one of the creative technologists from Google prototyped <a href="https://labs.google/lll/en">Little Language Lessons</a> using Gemini to <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/how-its-made-little-language-lessons-to-personalize-learning/">personalize language learning</a>.</p>

          <h3 class="purple">Weeks 5 - 8</h3>
          <p>Students will externalize their experience co-creating with AI, by producing an artifact that they will present at the <strong>Google-UWaterloo Symposium on the “Future of Learning”</strong>; these artifacts can take many forms, e.g., TedTalk, demos, video documentary, etc.</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong>  We are looking for undergraduate students (mostly 3A and above) and graduate students from <strong>all disciplines</strong> who have bold ideas about the future of learning.  Technical and design skills are desirable, but not required. </p>
        <p><strong>Teams:</strong> There will be roughly 12 teams, and each student team will consist of 2-3 students ideally from diverse backgrounds, with at least 1 student with technical (e.g., programming) and/or design (e.g., UX, Figma) skills. </p>
        <p><strong>Participation Agreement:</strong> Sponsor will receive a non-exclusive license to all student materials generated during the workshop, and the workshop will be filmed.  As a condition for participating in the workshop, students will be asked to review and sign a student participation agreement, outlining these and other terms and conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Program Expectations:</strong> Students are expected to attend all weekly sessions, with only one excused absence allowed.  Workshop participants will be invited to take part in a research study, aimed at understanding their experience with GenAI tools and working in multi-disciplinary teams.</p>
        <p><strong>Application Instructions:</strong> To be considered for this program, students must (1) submit an application via <a href="https://forms.gle/nwAGtmZzBgJkFiJb9">this form</a>, and (2) upload a transcript, resume and one reference letter (optional, but highly encouraged) to <a href="https://vault.cs.uwaterloo.ca/s/XmCN2gSW75L4Wpr">vault</a> by September 19, 2025.  The applications will be reviewed by a joint committee, and students will be notified of the results by email in late September.</p>
