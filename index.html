      <h1>Futures Lab: An AI+UX Prototyping Workshop</h1>
      <p>Fall 2025: "Learning Re-Imagined"</p>
    </noscript>
    <div id="maincontent">
      <p>Sponsored by Google and led by Prof. Edith Law at University of Waterloo, Futures Lab is an AI+UX prototyping workshop that engages university students from all disciplines to explore AI-empowered technology for the <strong>Future of Work and Learning</strong>. For Fall 2025, the theme is “Learning Re-Imagined”.</p>
      <p>In the “Learning Re-Imagined” Futures Lab, students will work in interdisciplinary teams over 8 weeks to conceptualize new types of learning tools &ndash; to help students acquire domain knowledge (e.g., concepts in chemistry), practice procedural skills (e.g., language learning), or develop certain disposition for learning (e.g., self-management, intercultural effectiveness, curiosity).  Students will learn how to prototype using <a href="https://gemini.google/overview/canvas/?hl=en">Gemini Canvas</a> to prototype learning tools for themselves or for others. As an example, one of the creative technologists from Google prototyped <a href="https://labs.google/lll/en">Little Language Lessons</a> using Gemini to <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/how-its-made-little-language-lessons-to-personalize-learning/">personalize language learning.</a></p>
      <p>In parallel, this workshop will cultivate the essential skills required to live and lead in an AI-driven world. Students will move beyond being passive users and become critical, discerning architects of their interactions with AI. This includes developing proficiency in prompt engineering, learning to rigorously test and validate AI outputs, critically examining AI-generated information for potential biases and inaccuracies, and thinking about the broader implications of AI technology and its adoption.</p>
      <h3>Students will:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>learn to prototype with cutting-edge GenAI tools and latest industry methods</li>
        <li>apply innovative problem solving to real-life, societal challenges</li>
        <li>collaborate in interdisciplinary teams to meet the needs of stakeholders</li>
        <li>develop solutions to augment their portfolio</li>
        <li>have the opportunity to further develop their project after the workshop, via research, open-source project or a new venture</li>
        <li>receive a certificate of completion</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="nospace">
        <p><strong>When:</strong> Oct 6, 2025 - Nov 24, 2025, Mondays 4:30pm-6:30pm</p>
        <p><strong>Where:</strong> Learning Lab @ Dana Porter Library, and other locations (e.g., Catalyst, Google, etc)</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong>  We are looking for undergraduate students (3A and above) and graduate students from all disciplines who have bold ideas about what the future of learning should look like.  Technical and design skills are desirable, but not required.</p>
      <p><strong>Teams:</strong> There will be roughly 12 teams, and each student team will consist of 2-3 students ideally from diverse backgrounds, with at least 1 student with technical (e.g., programming) and/or design (e.g., UX, Figma) skills.</p>
      <p><strong>Program Outcomes and Expectations:</strong> As a requirement for participating in the program, students need to agree to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ll4auZ7NZKsET3Ra2i5QS4FSerZVbHfG40hdL0H_TwY/edit?usp=sharing">Google's terms and conditions</a>.  Students are expected to attend all weekly sessions, with only one excused absence allowed.</p>
      <p><strong>Application Instructions:</strong> To be considered for this program, students must (1) submit an application via this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhSZEMSvtmJEVedZfW4rucZJqfWh2BRC_908A44gRQQAHTQw/viewform?usp=preview">form</a>, and (2) upload a transcript, resume and one reference letter (optional, but highly encouraged) by <strong>August 15, 2025</strong>.  The applications will be reviewed by a joint Google-UWaterloo committee, and students will be notified of the results by email in early September.</p>
