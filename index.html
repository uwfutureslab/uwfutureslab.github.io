      <h1>Futures Lab: An AI+UX Prototyping Workshop</h1>
      <p>Fall 2025: "Learning Re-Imagined"</p>
    </noscript>
    <div id="maincontent">
      <p>Sponsored by Google and led by Prof. Edith Law at University of Waterloo, Futures Lab is an AI+UX prototyping workshop that invites university students from all disciplines to explore <strong>how emerging AI technologies can reshape the way we learn and work</strong>.  For Fall 2025, the theme is “Learning Re-Imagined”.</p>
      <p>Over the course of 8 weeks, students will first examine core facets where AI is poised to transform learning (e.g., ideation, research, synthesis, composition, simulation). Building on this foundation, students will work both individually and in interdisciplinary teams to prototype learning tools, starting with their own personal learning goals and broadening the scope to consider how these solutions might scale to serve the needs of learners beyond themselves</p>
      <!--p>Students will work in interdisciplinary teams to prototype tools that address meaningful, real-world challenges—starting with their own personal goals around learning, broadly defined.  As their ideas develop, students will be encouraged to broaden their scope and consider how these solutions might scale to serve the needs of learners beyond themselves.</p-->
      <p>In parallel, this workshop will cultivate the essential skills required to live and lead in an AI-driven world. Students will move beyond being passive users and become critical, discerning architects of their interactions with AI. This includes developing proficiency in prompt engineering, learning to rigorously test and validate AI outputs, critically examining AI-generated information for potential biases and inaccuracies, and thinking about the broader implications of AI technology and its adoption.</p>

        <p><strong>When:</strong> Oct 6, 2025 - Dec 1, 2025, Mondays 4:30pm-6:30pm</p>
        <p><strong>Where:</strong> Tatham Center, University of Waterloo</p>
        <p><strong>Perks:</strong> Interaction with Google mentors, free food (during certain weeks)</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Students will:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>learn to prototype with cutting-edge GenAI tools and latest industry methods</li>
        <li>apply innovative problem solving to real-life, societal challenges</li>
        <li>collaborate in interdisciplinary teams to meet the needs of stakeholders</li>
        <li>develop solutions to augment their portfolio</li>
        <li>have the opportunity to further develop their project after the workshop, via research, open-source project or a new venture</li>
        <li>receive a certificate of completion</li>

        <h2>Program Overview</h2>
        <div class="schedule-item">
          <h3 class="blue">Weeks 1 - 4</h3>
          <p>Students will work in small teams, using <a href="https://gemini.google/overview/canvas/?hl=en">Gemini Canvas</a> to build multiple bespoke solutions for a learning problem that they have identified and take note of what works and what doesn't.  As an example, one of the creative technologists from Google prototyped <a href="https://labs.google/lll/en">Little Language Lessons</a> using Gemini to <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/how-its-made-little-language-lessons-to-personalize-learning/">personalize language learning</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="schedule-item">
          <h3 class="purple">Weeks 5 - 8</h3>
          <p>Students will externalize their experience co-creating with AI, by producing an artifact that they will present at the <strong>Google-UWaterloo Symposium on the “Future of Learning”</strong>; these artifacts can take many forms, e.g., TedTalk, demos, video documentary, etc.</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong>  We are looking for undergraduate students (mostly 3A and above) and graduate students from <strong>all disciplines</strong> who have bold ideas about the future of learning.  Technical and design skills are desirable, but not required. </p>
        <p><strong>Teams:</strong> There will be roughly 12 teams, and each student team will consist of 2-3 students ideally from diverse backgrounds, with at least 1 student with technical (e.g., programming) and/or design (e.g., UX, Figma) skills. </p>
        <!--p><strong>Program Outcomes and Expectations:</strong> As a requirement for participating in the program, students need to agree to Google's terms and conditions.  Students are expected to attend all weekly sessions, with only one excused absence allowed.  Workshop participants may also be invited to take part in a research study.</p-->
        <p><strong>Participation Agreement:</strong> Sponsor will receive a non-exclusive license to all student materials generated during the workshop, and the workshop will be filmed.  As a condition for participating in the workshop, students will be asked to review and sign a student participation agreement, outlining these and other terms and conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Program Expectations:</strong> Students are expected to attend all weekly sessions, with only one excused absence allowed.  Workshop participants will be invited to take part in a research study, aimed at understanding their experience with GenAI tools and working in multi-disciplinary teams.</p>
        <!--p><strong>Application Instructions:</strong> Applications will open in late-August or early-September. Please express your interest by joining this <a href="https://forms.gle/XH1JZo5sDMKeRgz67">waitlist</a>.</p--> 
        <p><strong>Application Instructions:</strong> To be considered for this program, students must (1) submit an application via <a href="https://forms.gle/nwAGtmZzBgJkFiJb9">this form</a>, and (2) upload a transcript, resume and one reference letter (optional, but highly encouraged) to <a href="https://vault.cs.uwaterloo.ca/s/XmCN2gSW75L4Wpr">vault</a> by September 15, 2025.  The applications will be reviewed by a joint committee, and students will be notified of the results by email in late September.</p>
