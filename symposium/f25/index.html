      <p>Join us at the <strong>Google-UWaterloo Symposium on the “Future of Learning”</strong>!  
      <p><a href="https://uwfutureslab.ca/offerings/f25/">Futures Lab</a> is an AI+UX workshop, where students work in interdisciplinary teams, using <a href="https://gemini.google/overview/canvas/?hl=en">Gemini Canvas</a>, <a href="aistudio.google.com"> Google AI Studio</a>, and many other Generative AI (GenAI) tools to build multiple bespoke solutions for a learning problem that they have identified.
      <p>We are inviting faculty, students, staff, industry representatives and community members to participate in the symposium, to celebrate the conclusion of the inaugural Futures Lab cohort.  The symposium starts with a participatory activity where attendees will gather in small groups to have provocative conversations about the role of AI in  learning and education. <b>Graduate students and faculty members who are doing cutting-edge research on learning, whether it be technology-related or not, are also invited to present</b> their work alongside the Futures Lab attendees.</p>
      <p>The Symposium will take place on <strong>December 1, 2025</strong> from 3:30pm-6:30pm in the Davis Center, University of Waterloo.</p>
