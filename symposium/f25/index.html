      <h1 class="heading-bg symposium bq bg">Google-UWaterloo Symposium on the “Future of Learning” (Fall 2025)</h1>
      <p>In the F25 Futures Lab AI+UX Workshop: "Learning Re-Imagined", students have worked in small teams, using <a href="https://gemini.google/overview/canvas/?hl=en">Gemini Canvas</a>, <a href="aistudio.google.com"> Google AI Studio</a>, and many other Generative AI (GenAI) tools to build multiple bespoke solutions for a learning problem that they have identified. At the <strong>Google-UWaterloo Symposium on the “Future of Learning”</strong>, students from the Futures Lab will externalize their experiences co-creating with AI, by presenting a creative artefact about their projects.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the symposium invites students and researchers from the university community to engage in provocative conversations around the use of AI in learning and education. The symposium starts with a participatory activity to get the community critically engaged in thinking and discussion about AI+Learning. Graduate students and researchers from the University of Waterloo engaged in cutting-edge research at the intersection of education and technology are also invited to present their work alongside the Futures Lab attendees.</p>
      <p>The Symposium will take place on <strong>December 1, 2025</strong> in the Davis Center (DC) lobby, University of Waterloo.</p>

        <p class="bq br">The symposium will begin with a brief opening talk explaining the Futures Lab and Future of Learning initiatives occuring at the University of Waterloo.</p>
        <h3 class="symposium"><strong>3:30PM - 4:30PM:</strong> Provocative Conversations around AI+Learning</h3>
        <p class="bq bb">After the opening, Futures Lab attendees and members of the University of Waterloo community are invited to discuss AI in the future of learning through a participatory activity in DC 1301 (fishbowl). More details about the activity, and a signup link for interest will be announced soon.</p>
        <h3 class="symposium"><strong>4:30PM - 6:00PM:</strong> Futures Lab Demos and Graduate Student Research Posters</h3>
        <div class="bq bg">
          <p>Afterwards, a poster session will run, showing off both the work of Futures Lab attendees and graduate student research at the intersection of AI and Learning. Futures Lab attendees will be given the opportunity to present a demo of their tool, creative artefact, and poster describing their process. Graduate students with related work will be given the opportunity to present a poster of their research, along with any relevant demos or artefacts.</p>
          <p>A combination of University of Waterloo researchers and Google staff will be in attendance to learn about the final artefacts created by each group/research projects by graduate students. Presenters are expected to give a short presentation of their work to these researchers and staff throughout the session.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="symposium"><strong>6:00PM - 6:30PM:</strong> Awards and Closing</h3>
        <p class="bq bp">After the session, groups and students will be given awards based off of their workshop or research projects.</p>
